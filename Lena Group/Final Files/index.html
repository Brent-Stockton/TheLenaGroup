              <p>Ken and Lisa Lena are both Chicago natives that transplanted to sunny Arizona with their four children, Kira, Gia, Aubriella and Jionni. Also not excluding their dog and cat Gino and Diva. Before moving to Arizona and pursuing a real estate career, Ken studied criminal justice in college and went on to have a 14 year career in law enforcement. A career in law enforcement has provided Ken with very important knowledge, skills and great life lessons. He has gained the skills needed to communicate with others and problem solve quickly and effectively. Ken prides himself on personal responsibility and compassion for all people from all walks of life while providing high quality professionalism. Since the launch of their real estate business Ken has received awards and has been recognized for being in the top 5% of all real estate professionals in the state of Arizona. If that wasn’t enough Ken and Lisa have also maintained a 100% 5 star review rating from all past clients.

              Ken and Lisa bring a strong sense of professionalism and empathy to all of their clients. They both know what it’s like to go through a complex home purchase as well as in depth searches to find the right place to call home. They have personally dealt with unscrupulous realtors that cared more about the commission than they did about the needs and wants of the client. These experiences have made us keenly aware of all the challenges and opportunities that lay before you in your next real estate endeavor. We pride ourselves on obtaining friendships with all our clients which makes every transaction become personal for us and not just another commission check. As your real estate professionals we’ll walk you through the process step by step and always give you 100% of our attention. We would be honored to partner with you to help you see your vision in whatever area of real estate you’re searching for.

              Whether in Arizona or out of state, and no matter if your a first time home buyer, seller or investor, from residential to commercial and all in between, there is no task too big or too small for us to handle. We always make sure all your needs are kept in first place and met with the highest degree of professionalism. We would absolutely love to earn your business and referrals.
